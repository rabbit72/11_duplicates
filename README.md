# Anti-Duplicator

This script is find duplicates files in the entered directory.

# Quick start

```bash
$ python3 duplicates.py <path_to_directory>
```

Running on Windows is similar.

*(Possibly requires call of 'python' executive instead of just 'python3'.)*

# Example

```bash
$ python3 duplicates.py .
Duplicates:

```

# Project Goals
